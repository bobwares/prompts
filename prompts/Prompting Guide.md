| Task        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Context     | The model should use the provided context to inform its outputs, capture relevant semantic relationships, and tailor the content to the specific situation described. Context may include background information, key details, goals, and target audience. |
| Role        | Specify the role the AI should adopt, such as expert, advisor, pair programmer, or teacher to guide its approach to the task. The chosen role helps set the appropriate boundaries and perspective.                                                      |
| Format      | Specifying the desired output format (e.g. paragraph, list, dialogue, table) gives the model a clear structure to organize its response. Including hints about desired length and level of detail further optimizes the output.                          |
| Tone        | The model should aim for the requested tone (e.g. casual, professional, managerial) to align with the context and role. Tone influences word choice, sentence structure, and emotional timbre of the output.                                   |
| Examples    | Providing relevant examples demonstrates the kind of output expected and can significantly improve the model's performance on the task. Examples act as templates for the model to learn from and emulate.                                               |
| Constraints | Explicitly stating any constraints, restrictions or things to avoid keeps the model operating within set boundaries. This could include topic scope limits, viewpoints to exclude, confidential information, or stylistic choices to prevent.            |
